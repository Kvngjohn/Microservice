# Microservice App
A basic Node.js microservice application using Express.
## Installation
To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local Repo. To find the repository URL, go to your GitHub repository page, click the green "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS URL. For example: `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`.
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Install Dependencies:**
   npm install
3. **Start the Application:**
   npm start
5. **Access the Application:**
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (default port). If the port is configurable, check the application settings or the environment variable `PORT` in the code to verify or change it.
You should see a "Hello World!" message (if everything is set up correctly).
